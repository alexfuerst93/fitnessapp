# Fitnessapp for athletes

The webapp is geared towards athletes who consistently lifted weights for at least three years.
Advanced lifters are faced with highly complex workout routines to still increase their performance even after several years of strength training.
In order to ease the complexity, this web application was built. Specifically, it implements the training method from [Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger](https://www.amazon.de/Beyond-Bigger-Leaner-Stronger-Advanced/dp/1938895258).

:sparkles: The project was built using Python, Django and Bootstrap.
